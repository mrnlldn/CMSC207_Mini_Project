# Mini Project

This is a simple and lightweight static website built using plain HTML and CSS. It demonstrates fundamental web development principles while maintaining a clean and easily maintainable structure.  

Since it uses only standard web technologies, no build tools or dependencies are required—just open it in a browser, and it works!

Although this is a simple static website project, it is still covered by a license to ensure proper usage and distribution. Please refer to the LICENSE file for detailed information.

## Local Development

To view the website locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.  

For a smoother development experience, it's recommended to use a local development server with live reloading (hot module replacement). This allows you to see changes instantly without manually refreshing the browser. Some easy ways to set up a local server include such as [VS Code's live server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

# Features
- **Easy navigation**: Sections are clearly organized and accessible via the header menu.
- **Responsive design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Multi-file structure**: This project is divided into the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files similar to how bigger projects are structured.
- **Fun features**: Such as a paw cursor since I love cats and some smooth scrolls to make the project look better.
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper HTML5 elements to improve accessibility and follow modern web development best practices.
- **No dependencies**: No external frameworks or libraries required, keeping it lightweight and simple to maintain.

# Deployment
Since this is a fully static website, it can be deployed to any hosting service that supports static files. For this project, I chose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) because:

- It’s free and easy to set up.
- It integrates directly with my GitHub repository.
- It has a good developer experience.
